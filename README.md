## Overview

The **U-Type-001 RoleMarker** system serves as a framework for managing command structures with specific roles assigned to different users. This ensures that only authorized personnel can execute certain commands, enhancing security and control. The design focuses on modularity and ease of integration into existing systems.

## Features

- **Role Marking System**: Assign roles to users for controlled access.
- **Conditional Licensing**: Use of licenses that restrict certain functionalities based on conditions.
- **Execution Control**: Commands can be marked as executable or non-executable based on user roles.
- **Fingerprint Tagging**: Unique identification for each user to enhance security.
- **GPT Control Layer**: Integration with GPT for advanced command processing.
- **Modular Command Structure**: Easily extendable to fit various applications.
- **Publicly Viewable**: The system's architecture can be viewed, but usage is restricted.
